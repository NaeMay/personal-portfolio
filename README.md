“Kenthesha Evans Personal Portfolio”

## Description
The **Personal Portfolio Webpage** showcases my expertise as a **Front-End Developer**, **FoodTech Entrepreneur**, and **Cybersecurity Analyst**, blending AI innovation, culinary passion, and American small business support. Built for freeCodeCamp’s Responsive Web Design certification, this portfolio highlights seven projects, my Stratford Cooking and Catering Diploma with Highest Honors, and ongoing Computer Programming Diploma at Stratford Career Institute. Inspired by Donald Trump’s no-tax-on-tips policy, Elon Musk’s AI advancements with xAI, and Gordon Ramsay’s culinary excellence, it features a responsive design, WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility, and a MAGA-themed aesthetic (red `#b22234`, blue `#3c3b6e`, gold `#feac32`, dark green `#00471b`) with glitch animations, Orbitron font, and Font Awesome 6.5.1 icons.

The portfolio includes a readable and scrollable Welcome Section, centered Credentials, a project filter, scroll animations, and a mobile-friendly navigation toggle. It lists seven projects, including the PatriotPlates AI & PatriotSecurity AI Interactive Menu for the 2026 launch, and links to credentials (diploma, transcripts, verification letter) hosted on Netlify.
